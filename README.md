# InitialValueProblemSolvers
Research project aiming to apply well-developed numerical algorithms to approximate solutions to the Initial Value Problem. The focus is on creating a simple and minimalistic Object Oriented design framework in the hope that methods can slot in and out of more abstractly defined problems.

This is the second part of the project. The first of which solely consisted of implementing numerical methods to specific examples, where new code was written for each example. The purpose of this was for my personal understanding of simple concepts like stability and convergence.

The focus now is, I suppose, more formal. Can I create a very simple, yet flexible suite of a few One-Step and Linear Multi-Step methods which can be applied to both scalar and vector 1st Order Initial Value Problems. 

The motive behind this change in focus is I haven't been able to find in any literature a true Object-Oriented approach to IVP solvers - I suppose that this stems from the fact that most literature is written by academics who are not in need of one-size-fits-all(/most) solutions.
